This repository contains classes I've created for use in APPM 4600 assignments. Such classes in Python are in mypkg, and MATLAB files are in +mypkg. There are also files in root such as test files, and homework code.

Now I'm adding some information to the readme. I noticed it took a really long time to get to the end of this file in VI. If only there was a VI command for that.

So I found a nifty way to do this. What you do is... you hit escape and then while holding shift, hit g and a successively. Wow!
